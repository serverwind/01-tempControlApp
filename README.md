Status: <b>finished</b>.

## Overview

Tech used: React, Tailwind, Vite.

### Task: Develop a Temperature Control App

### Description:

You will be creating a Temperature Control App that allows users to adjust the temperature. The background color of the app will change dynamically based on the current temperature.

### Requirements:

1. **UI Components:**
   - Display the current temperature in Celsius.
   - Two buttons: one to increase the temperature and one to decrease it.
2. **Functional Requirements:**
   - The temperature should start at 20°C.
   - Users should be able to increase the temperature by 1°C at a time.
   - Users should be able to decrease the temperature by 1°C at a time.
3. **Background Color Change:**
   - The background color should change based on the current temperature:
     - **Temperature < 0°C:** Background should be blue.
     - **Temperature from 0°C to 15°C:** Background should be light blue.
     - **Temperature from 16°C to 25°C:** Background should be white.
     - **Temperature from 26°C to 35°C:** Background should be orange.
     - **Temperature > 35°C:** Background should be red.

### Additional Requirements:

- Use React for developing the application.
- Ensure a responsive design so the app looks good on different devices.
- Write clean and understandable code, following best practices.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- The user interface correctly displays the current temperature.
- The buttons function correctly to increase/decrease the temperature.
- The background color changes according to the current temperature.
